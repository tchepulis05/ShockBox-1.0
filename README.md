# Shock-Box-2021
The Shock Box is a randomized shocking device that has a 4 in 5 chance of delivering a shock to the user.  The device uses a tingler kit (found here: https://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/prodinfo.asp?number=C6740) to deliver the shock.  An Arduino Uno and a relay control the tingler kit.  The device accepts 9vdc input from the 9v battery connector on the back of the box.  The conducting pads for the tingler kit are located on the front of the box.  There are also 3 LEDs on the device's breadboard.  The green LED is the power indicator, which is lit whenever the device's Arduino UNO is running the installed program.  The blue LED is the winner indicator.  This LED will flash for 10 seconds if the user guesses the button correctly.  An active buzzer can be added in series with the blue LED to add a sound effect when the button is guessed correctly.  The red LED is the shock indicator.  This LED will light whenever the tingler kit is being powered by the relay.
